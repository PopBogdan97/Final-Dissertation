\chapter{Bitcoin Cash}
\label{cha:bch}

"Imagine you have a dollar in your wallet, and you put it aside for a while and 
then realise that one coin has split in two. Sounds weird? Not in the cryptocurrency 
world." That is an analogy with the fiat currency reported in an article of 
Shouth China Morning Post\cite{scmp}.\\
Bitcoin is like a software, but, due to its distributed nature, unlike all the 
software we know, there isn't a single entity who determines how it should be 
updated.
